:^) Edition

Here's the Changelog:

General:
	-No more wildcards!	
		-I'd like to hope this would fix the single/auto fire lock bugs	
	-Converted everything to the new hook (3.2.0), no need for you to edit in DMCWO scripts into your .yml anymore!
	-Added stupid shit to the console/hook log that serves no purpose in the actual game! :^)
		-This can be disabled, check DMCWO.lua
	

All scripts (excluding scripts in the "Extra" folder):
	-Changed version note to v1.2


DMCWO.lua:
	-Sets up all the scripts and contains several strings that will be printed to the console/PD2Hook.log randomly when the "rebalance" scripts are all set up
		-You can make this part shut the fuck up by setting "DMCWO.Stfu" to "true"
		-You can also make the setup parts shut the fuck up by setting "DMCWO.Setup_Stfu" to "true"
	-This script set will disable the more recently updated standalone scripts from this mod (Only "Real Weapon & Mod Names" is affected for now)


gat_physics.lua:
	-Changed formatting to use "RequiredScript"
	-Contains code to block fire rate multipler upgrades
	-Several attachments alter ROF, reload speeds, ADS times, etc.
		-I'll release a .txt what mentions what does what
	-Having a laser attached and **ON** will reduce hipfire spread by 25%
		-Does NOT affect shotguns
		-The code for checking if the laser is on is pretty much a copy of the code for checking if the angled sights are on
	

shotgat_physics.lua:
	-Changed formatting to use "RequiredScript"


tact_reload.lua:
	-Changed formatting to use "RequiredScript"
	-The Mosin and C96 only load how much their clips can feed
		-You can only reload the Mosin when empty
		-You can only reload the C96 if your current mag is empty, 10 or lower when using the 20 round mag
	

rebalance_general.lua:
	-Will print if it's working to the console/log
	-Needs to have run and work for "rebalance.lua" to run


rebalance.lua:
	-Will print if it's working to the console/log
	-Requires "rebalance_general.lua" to be working correctly to run at all
	-Needs to have run and work for "rebalance_attach.lua" to run
	-Condensed weapon stats, removed the rewritten tables and instead altered the table values themselves, similarly to how I do melee weapons
	-Fixed the VHS-2 having lower penetration than the other 5.56 NATO ARs
	-Possibly fixed optic positioning on the MSR
	-The C96, TEC-9 and G18c no longer benefit from Equilibrium Aced (The 2x ROF multiplier skill)
		-5fast9me
	

rebalance_attach.lua:
	-Will print if it's working to the console/log
	-Requires "rebalance.lua" to be working correctly to run at all
	-Undid the damage increase I made to 000 Buck, it's now back down to +40 damage	
		-I didn't make the connection of increasing the base damage of shotguns and increasing the damage of 000 Buck together creating absurd damage outputs pretty much making ALL DW cops keel over 90% of the time from things like the 870 and Mosconi, even from body shots at a respectable distance.	
			-You can still kill DW cops in one hit, I'm just reducing the chance of it killing them with a single bodyshot. Headshots will still murderize them, at least more than before I even buffed shotguns/000 Buck in the first place.
		

realnames.lua:
	-Made some small tweaks
